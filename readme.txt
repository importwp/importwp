Import WP is a powerful Importer & Exporter with a visual data selection tool that makes it easy to Export or Import any XML or CSV file to WordPress.

== Description ==

Import WP makes it easy to import any xml or csv files to WordPress, and export any wordpress data to xml, csv or json.

Import WP is a WordPress Importer and Exporter plugin that makes importing and exporting wordpress content easy, fast and straightforward.

Each import has been optimised to the following steps:

1. Attach an XML or CSV file.
2. Select each part of a WordPress post, page, category, taxonomy or user and mapping it to the file.
3. Set what is used to identify each record, and select what the importer can insert, update and delete.
4. Run the importer.

Import WP importer fully supports all core WordPress data types such as Posts, Pages, Attachments, Tags, Categories, and Users. This means you can easily import data from any xml or csv into all core WordPress data types using our data selection tool to visually map every field.

Each export is comprised of the following steps:

1. Select what WordPress fields should be exported.
2. Select the desired output format.
3. Run the exporter.

Import WP exporter allows you to export posts, pages, custom post types, attachment urls and details, tags, categories, custom taxonomies, users, and custom fields. This means you can easily generate csv, xml or json files containing only the data you need.
