Import WP, a simple, fast and powerful XML and CSV import solution, Making it easy to import posts, pages, categories, tags, users and attachments.

== Description ==

Import and Export WordPress data with ease using Import WP, a WordPress import export plugin that  works with any XML or CSV file, there are no special requirements for how your csv file is laid out, or the structure of your xml file. Import WP’s xml and csv import process can handle it all.

XML and CSV import files can be fetched from a remote URL, datafeed or FTP server, downloaded from Google Sheets, or manually uploaded to the importer.

Import WP comes with an intuitive data selection tool that makes it simple to select and map any WordPress field to any part of your xml or csv file.

Import WP allows you to import into all core WordPress data types from WordPress posts, pages, categories, tags, users and attachments, we offer many free addons that allow integration for third party plugins, and a premium upgrade to import into any custom post type, custom taxonomy, or custom fields.

Our optimised **WordPress importer** makes it easy to **export and import CSV and XML files** into WordPress posts, pages, categories, and tags. We have simplified the process to **Import attachments, images, and any WordPress data** using our custom visual data selection tools that make it straightforward to import XML or CSV files from any **data feed**.

Our **WordPress exporter** allows you to **export CSV, XML or JSON files** with data from any wordpress post type or taxonomy, including exporting custom fields, images, attachments, and related terms. This means you can easily export CSV, XML or JSON files containing only the WordPress data and structure you need.

= Import CSV and XML files to WordPress posts, categories and users =

To create a **csv importer** or **xml importer** the steps are the same, except that xml files contain a nested data structure, instead of csv files that containing rows and headings.

1. **Choose Import file** - Import an XML or CSV file by either uploading a file, downloading from a remote url, or from a remote FTP.
2. **Map data** - Select what parts of your import file should be used to create and update a WordPress record.
3. **Set Permissions** - Set what is used to identify each record, and select what the importer can insert, update and delete.
4. **Run the importer**.

= Import WordPress Attachments from XML / CSV files =

**Import WordPress attachments** from CSV and XML files from either a **remote url**, an **ftp server**, the **websites filesystem**, or the **WordPress media library**. 

Attachments can be downloaded every time the importer runs, or can check the media library to **use an existing version** if it exists already, saving media from downloading duplicate images.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to Import XML files using our XML Importer =

Our **XML importer** allows you to easily **import xml files** made up from any XML schema / structure. 

When **importing XML files** you first need to set the document base path, the XML base path defines what makes up a record and is used when calculating how many records will be imported.

Using our XML visual data selector you can choose what data to be imported from each record's XML nodes attributes or text, or you can manually select data using custom written XPath queries.

= How to Import CSV files using our CSV Importer =
Our **CSV importer** makes it possible to **import CSV files** containing any number of columns or rows, with settings to set the CSV delimiter character that is used to separate each data cells defaulting to a comma, set the CSV enclosure character that is used to wrap around each data cell defaulting to a quotation mark, and set what character encoding was used when creating the csv.

Using our CSV data selector you can visually choose what columns should be used when importing each record.
