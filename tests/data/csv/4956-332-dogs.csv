Hello I’m Dane. I’m looking for a very understanding owner as I struggle to trust people to begin with. I will need someone who is going to take things slow with me until I have built up a bond. Once I trust you then we will be best friends, I can’t wait to receive lots of cuddles and kisses, and I will always make you laugh with my personality. 

My carers notes
Dane is seeking a very niche home where several things will need to be considered to ensure his success. He will need a quiet rural place to live where there is limited hustle and bustle around the area that could overwhelm him. Dane’s new family will need to be willing to invest plenty of time and patience He is seeking an adult-only home with possibility to live with another dog following a successful dog meet here at our centre. Despite being a smaller great Dane cross he will still need an owner with experience of larger dogs and physically be able to manage him as he can be reactive towards new people and other dogs. He has also previously guarded female staff members so will need some further positive training to discourage this he will need multiple meets at the centre so you can see his true personality before going home.

Cookie is a pleasure to be with when she knows and trusts you, but trust is a very big thing for our girl. Cookie can be nervous and reactive mainly around new men she meets. Because of this Cookie is walked on a harness and muzzle. She walks beautifully with her k9 carers and responds well to positive reinforcement.
Cookie forms strong bonds with her favourite people and due to a challenging start in life, she tends to find it worrying when left alone. We'd love to find her a patient and compassionate family who will always be around at home to keep her company.
Once she knows you well, she'll relish every second in your company, joining you on fun walks, playing her favourite games and participating in her training. Cookie is a super intelligent girl who thrives off learning and any activity that'll keep her mind stimulated.

My carers notes
Patricia is a beautiful loyal and loving girl once she knows you and has built up a bond. She is very bright and keen; she would suit an active home that can provide her positive outlets for her energy. 
She has previously been housetrained but prefers to spend her time outdoors. For this reason, she will need access to a secure and private garden. She will need gentle introductions to living life indoors.
Due to lack of experience when it comes to interacting with other canines, she can become easily frustrated in their presence. She will hugely benefit from building up his social skills with other dogs of a calm and friendly nature but needs to be the only pet in the home. The youngest members of his family should be aged at least 16 years of age.
Her new family may need to make several visits to the centre and work with our behaviour contact before she is ready for adoption.

Gemma can be a little wary of new people but is very loving once she knows you and she will become confident around new people quite quickly, if introduced correctly.
She knows how to sit and give paw but may require further training. She will drop her toys using the commands 'leave' or 'drop' but only if you have another toy to give her. Her favourite toys are tennis balls.

I am a friendly girl, but can be quite unsure and barky with other dogs.  Because of this I wear a muzzle, over my dogmatic, when out on walks.  I do enjoy my walks and my K9 carers are starting to socialise me with the other dogs and I am making progress.
I can sit and also enjoy my treats.

Hello, Im Chyna. I am a super fun staffie with lots of character. I love going on lots of walks and I love to play. I am looking for an active home where I can go on lots of adventures and recive the ongoing training that i need.

My carers notes
Chyna is a boisterous dog who will need alot of mental and physical stimulation. She will need a very active home who can take her on lots of adventures. In our care Chyna has had trouble socialising with other dogs therefore is looking for a new home where she is the only dog and can received careful socialisation. Chyna enjoys human company therefore she will need her alone time built up slowly once settled into her new home.
